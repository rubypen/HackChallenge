**A student-built iOS app that centralizes Cornell course info and study resources.**

Created during a Hack Challenge by a team of 5 using **Swift**.

## 💡 What It Does

StudyCentral helps Cornell students explore and research courses more effectively. Users can:

- Search for and browse **official course details** like descriptions, schedules, and prerequisites
- Access **prelim prep resources** recommended by students who’ve already taken the course
- **Contribute and organize resources** by topic (e.g., “Dynamic Programming” for CS 4820) so others can study more efficiently
- Avoid the clutter of random links and benefit from peer-curated material

## 🚀 Why It Matters

StudyCentral streamlines the process of choosing and surviving courses. It connects students through shared resources and aims to reduce stress around prelim season by making relevant, high-quality material easy to find.
